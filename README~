Build Instructions:

Type 'make system' to build and install
modifications to the minix kernel

Restart.

Type 'make protectfile' to build the protectfile
program

Type 'make test' to run a simple script that encrypts,
cats, decrypts and then cats a file.

To see that a file you encrypted is actually encrypted,
you'll either have to log in as another user to look at
it, or copy it to a different machine to see that it's 
actually garbage.
